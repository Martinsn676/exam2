# Your project title

![image](https://github.com/Martinsn676/exam2/blob/main/hotel%20screenshot.PNG)

A hotel reservation page made with a lackluster backend to show what I have "learned" after 2 whole years of school. You can only filter by search and not even sort by date, price or title. The design is made to seem modern and with the same design between the app and website. I was not getting any visual direction by the useless teachers and this was made quickly as it was a low paid job done as charity, when the awful truth was that I paid them to be getting this task.
